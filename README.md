This reoository contains the code and the raw data required for Food Delivery Prediction Machine Learning model . Food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters. To develop an effective prediction model, we began by thoroughly cleaning the dataset, ensuring it was free from errors and inconsistencies. This step was vital in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the model's predictions.

Feature engineering was then employed to extract valuable insights from the dataset. By considering factors such as delivery person age, ratings, location coordinates, and time-related variables, we aimed to capture key variables that influence delivery time. These engineered features contributed to the model's predictive capabilities.

Using regression algorithms like linear regression, decision tree, random forest,XGBoost we built the predictive model. It was trained on a subset of the dataset using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score were used to assess the model's accuracy. The food delivery time prediction model empowers businesses to optimize their operations and improve the overall delivery experience for their customers.
